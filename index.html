                    <div class="question">
                        <p>How much does a website cost? What does a Website.com subscription include?</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>The cost of running a website can be broken into 3 main elements: the domain, hosting, and the way to make the website.</p>
                        <p>A domain is the unique web address that visitors can type into the browser to find your website, e.g. www.website.com. A domain name is typically a yearly cost, ranging from around $20/year and up.</p>
                        <p>Website hosting allows your website files to be stored and seen on the internet. This is typically a monthly ongoing cost, usually around $14.99/month and up.</p>
                        <p>The website platform used to create a website is another factor to consider. The cost of making a website may vary depending on whether you choose a DIY approach, or hire a web designer or developer. Hiring a web expert can be a significant expense that generally requires an initial design cost and an ongoing maintenance fee.</p>
                        <p>With Website.com premium plans, everything is included to create your website, including a professional domain name for 1 year, web hosting to host your content, and a website builder with easy tools to create your site, sell products, reach international audiences, and market your online presence. Premium plans range from $4/month (promo price for the first year), which is an extremely cost effective way to own a professional website.</p>
                        <p>With a free Website.com plan, you can get a free website name and get online entirely for free. Keep in mind that Website.com premium plans include a professional domain name registration, more website pages and advanced features to lend more professionalism to your site.</p>
                        <p>Your web content will be stored on our secure servers located in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
